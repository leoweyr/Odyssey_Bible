# Preface

#### English| [简体中文](preface-zh_cn.md)

Preface? It means that I'm here to introduce the reasons why I have this series of thinking.

It all started when I was 13 years old and be on quest of **how should the world go on, if the universe isn't being**. This question is a very fantastic thought experiment, trying to imagine now with your brain, you may get the experience of **reaching the limit and boundary of human physiology**. The essence of this phenomenon is that when the **extreme only** in our cognition does not exist, it is difficult for the human brain to logically come up with another form of container that can carry **existence**. In other words, this is the feeling of powerlessness produced by paradoxical conflict.

I still remember the topic which be led by my intern teacher, "Do you have any puzzles that you have been unable to solve?" I brought that up in class, but apparently, my intern teacher was unable to answer the question on the spot. Ironically, then she asked me to state the process and gains of solving this problem by a moment passed, I could only pretend to say that went back to my nice real life instead of sticking to its. In fact it has never been resolved...

Since that, I have been thinking about the derivative of this question which is **the relationship between human beings and the unknown** from time to time. 

**The relationship between human beings and the unknown** can also be understood as **the relationship between existence and the unknown**. I think that when human beings truly realize **the relationship between existence and the unknown** one day, it is like a robot realizing the Buddha-Dharma, which is a kind of progress by crossing the control of the unknown. What this *Odyssey Bible* does is not to interpret this relationship, but to raise other questions and hypotheses about it.

How difficult is it for the human race to comprehend this relationship?  Recalling the thought experiment mentioned earlier in this piece, it's not null about **"isn't being"**, but completely **none**. It is similar to thinking about **how the living entity will continue after the death of a biological creature**, a sense of powerlessness. But the latter has a known conclusion, **the demise of living entities is the inevitable result of biological death**. And the former still has the possibility that human beings have not touched the unknown beyond this universe, but we still include those unknown possibilities, perhaps **multiverse** or **universes beyond this universe**, both into the thought experiment statement the category of **"the universe"**. And then continue thinking... Contradicting yourself? But it is the process that one needs to go through to fully understand **the relationship between existence and the unknown**. ***It's like low-dimensional beings can't understand the existence of high-dimensional[^common].***

With the growth of age, knowledge and experience, I seem to be able to systematically integrate these thoughts, and now I have finally made up my mind to express them as articles and share them with you who are reading the *Odyssey Bible*. The discussion will be divided into chapters and categories from three perspectives: Theology, Belief, Paradoxed. You might as well get involved and let go of gender, nationality, race and prejudice, you and I are all fellow human beings.

[^common]: **Using the popular understanding in Mass Consciousness to explain the previous content, it does not represent the definition that *Odyssey Bible* wants to convey. "Mass Consciousness" is an important concept in the Belief chapter of *Odyssey Bible*.**
