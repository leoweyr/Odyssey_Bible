## Belief Advance

English | [简体中文](belief_advance-zh_cn.md)

Since we have discussed a lot and it seems that human beings are so impotent, then what is the meaning of human existence? **For the Belief and driven by it.**

The common definition of **"religion"** is empirical. Any belief with a collective nature is considered **"religion"**, even if one is an atheist but believes in materialism[^disambiguational1]. In traditional religion[^common], there are two kinds of status: **leaders and followers**. As for a universal belief, it arises spontaneously in people's hearts, seemingly contradicting the process of the emergence and spread of ideas explained in **Mass Consciousness**. Yet, from the perspective of **The Infinitesimal Principle**, it just proves the universality of this belief.

[^disambiguational1]:**Not all atheists adhere to materialism, somebody may hold other views. This specifically uses materialists as examples.**

[^common]:**Referring not only to tangible religions but also extending to the traditional forms of "religion".**
