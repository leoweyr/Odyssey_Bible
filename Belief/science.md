## Science

#### English | [简体中文](science-zh_cn.md)

Science, as commonly understood, refers to the special sense of science defined in Marxist philosophy as **"concrete science"** or also known as **"natural science"**, which encompasses disciplines such as mathematics[^disambiguational 1], physics, chemistry, etc. It is independent of the **"philosophy"** defined in Marxist philosophy.

> "Concrete science serves as the foundation of philosophy, while philosophy provides a generalization and summary of concrete scientific knowledge. The progress of concrete science drives the development of philosophy, and philosophy provides a worldview and methodology guidance for the study of concrete science."
>
> —— Marxist philosophy

Special science is essentially consistent with the birth of religion in human history, **one of Belief**, just in keeping with the spirit of the times, worshiping **"the nature"**[^disambiguational 2]. The human's knowledge of **the big picture of nature**[^common] determines the threshold and roof of special science. You must be familiar with a more traditional name, scientific research[^disambiguational 3], which is used to describe the enterprise of special science.

In a general sense, science should be summed up as **the digging of principles**, which is not satisfied with being loyal to a particular **nature picture**. The **"principle"** has infinite possibilities but still persistently pursuing it. So philosophy is theoretically contained in science.

General science meets Popper's criteria for science.

[^disambiguational 1]:**Mathematics correctly belongs to the category of "formal science", but according to the common understanding of science, classifying it as "nature science" can better combine with the *Odyssey Bible* to discuss "special science".**
[^disambiguational 2]:**Refers to human's explanation of nature and its complete and systematic theory that is considered to be truth, rather than the physical entity itself.**
[^common]:**The basic backdrop sandbox used to limit all scientific research in Mass Consciousness. This "scientific research" is expressed in a methodological sense.**

[^disambiguational 3]:**Noun, referring to various specific instances rather than the meaning in terms of methodology.**
